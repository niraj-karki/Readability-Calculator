# Readability-Calculator

## Background
Authors and editors are often concerned with the “readability” of their articles and
manuscripts: how difficult is a sentence to understand? is this document written at a level
appropriate for its target audience? As a student author, you might wish to determine the
cognitive complexity of your term paper or thesis. This leads to the question: are there
any metrics for measuring the concept of readability?
One way to approach this problem is by computing the Flesch Index (FI), a numerical
measure of the readability of English text. Originally invented for evaluating the
difficulty of reading U.S. Army training manuals, it has since become ubiquitous.
